1. User parameters is not correct. We should take everything after ":" like one word. 
   Second parameter (mode) need to be save.

2. User or Nickname doesn't have a particular order

3. This is showing the admin and regular as join ? which is wrong .. the admin is already part of the channel.. fix it 
   When admin send message the members of the channel doesn't get it bc the admin not part of the channel..
    admin is part of the channel at the same time not part , bc when admin send other client dont recieve but when cleint send other admin recieves
